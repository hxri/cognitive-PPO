# Blocked Unlock Pickup

### Description

The agent has to pick up a box which is placed in another room, behind a
locked door. The door is also blocked by a ball which the agent has to move
before it can unlock the door. Hence, the agent has to learn to move the
ball, pick up the key, open the door and pick up the object in the other
room. This environment can be solved without relying on language.

### Mission Space

"pick up the {color} {type}"

{color} is the color of the box. Can be "red", "green", "blue", "purple",
"yellow" or "grey".

{type} is the type of the object. Can be "box" or "key".

    `(OBJECT_IDX, COLOR_IDX, STATE)`
- `OBJECT_TO_IDX` and `COLOR_TO_IDX` mapping can be found in
    [minigrid/minigrid.py](minigrid/minigrid.py)
- `STATE` refers to the door state with 0=open, 1=closed and 2=locked
