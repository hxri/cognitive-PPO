# Memory S7

### Description

This environment is a memory test. The agent starts in a small room where it
sees an object. It then has to go through a narrow hallway which ends in a
split. At each end of the split there is an object, one of which is the same
as the object in the starting room. The agent has to remember the initial
object, and go to the matching object at split.

### Observation Encoding

- Each tile is encoded as a 3 dimensional tuple:
    `(OBJECT_IDX, COLOR_IDX, STATE)`
- `OBJECT_TO_IDX` and `COLOR_TO_IDX` mapping can be found in
    [minigrid/minigrid.py](minigrid/minigrid.py)
- `STATE` refers to the door state with 0=open, 1=closed and 2=locked

### Rewards

A reward of '1' is given for success, and '0' for failure.

1. The agent reaches the correct matching object.
2. The agent reaches the wrong matching object.
3. Timeout (see `max_steps`).
